## Bug ticket #6341

Hello from the QA team,

We got an user complaint from a person called _Mikiko Toyoda_. She complains that she can't get payments through our system.

We suspect that it's because she doesn't have a middle name, and thus the object check fails. I added a skipped test to `payment-01.test.js`. Could you:

1) unskip the middle name test
2) fix the code
3) rerun the tests and check that it passes

## Feature request #6342

According to previous discussion, we are dropping support for Amex cards. I added a skipped test to `payment-01.test.js`. Please unskip the test and fix the code accordingly.

1) unskip the Amex card test
2) fix the code
3) rerun the tests and check that it passes
